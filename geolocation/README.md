This is a project based on a [walkthrough](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/02/03/how-to-use-restful-apis-with-django.html#basic-example-geo-location-api)

Interfaces with a geolocation API.

You might need to install requests for this app,
as I've not put them in requirements.txt

`$ pip install requests`

Have used this free API to get geolocation info:
```
https://www.geoplugin.com/
```

Other potential api would have been: `http://ip-api.com/json/`
